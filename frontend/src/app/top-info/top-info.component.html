                The k-means clustering method is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to identify clusters in a dataset. It's algorithm is stated as:
                <ol>
                    <li>Specify number of clusters K.</li>
                    <li>Initialize centroids by first shuffling the dataset and then randomly selecting K data
                        points
                        for the centroids without replacement.
                    </li>
                    <li>Keep iterating until there is no change to the centroids. i.e assignment of data points to
                        clusters
                        isnâ€™t
                        changing.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Compute the sum of the squared distance between data points and all centroids.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Assign each data point to the closest cluster (centroid).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Compute the centroids for the clusters by taking the average of the all data points
                                that belong to each
                                cluster.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
